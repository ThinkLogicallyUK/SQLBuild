## Welcome

Welcome to SQLBuild. 

SQLBuild is a SQL focused IaC tool for deploying SQL and appropriate landing zone resources on premises and into the cloud. The tool aims to simplify this complex task and to provide a cloud agnostic method (where possible) for defining infrastructure and sql instance configurations.

For information on SQLBuild and how to beta test the tool, please go to [https://sqlbuild.com](https://sqlbuild.com)

This project has currently not been published to Github and resides in an Azure DevOps repository whilst in beta. Upon completion of the beta, the product will be released as a dual license product with 2 editions, community and enterprise. The open source community edition will be deployed at this stage to Github.
